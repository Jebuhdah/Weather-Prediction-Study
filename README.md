Introduction Section
The goal of the study is to construct a model based on the weather dataset, that can be used to 
acceptably predict if it will rain tomorrow, or equivalently the value of RainTomorrow. The 
model will include various weather characteristics as predictors that are influential. Precipitation 
prediction is important in many fields, for example, it can help to improve efficiency of planting 
and harvesting; logistics companies will be interested in knowing the weather to make sure 
shipments arrive on time.
